NOTE: I tried my best to keep it fair and a bit spread out for the most part. If anyone wants
to swap with anyone or make changes, go ahead.

Time estimates are fairly conservative and include time taken to familiar yourself with the system
and to test your components. The time estimates should be taken with a grain of salt, as they can't
take into aspect the possibility of difficulties. Thus, they could be terribly overestimated, or
terribly underestimated. I also can't extrapoliate my guesses well because I'm not very familiar with
everyone elses' skills and familiarity. Best to give yourself at least twice as much time as the
estimate, to be safe.

Finally, this only includes the time needed to get what's pretty much the bare essentials
implemented. All the nice to have features (like database trimming, restoring files from a specific date,
and scanning everything once on opening the program) can only be implemented if the entire program is
completed.
