	This is the release version of the log4j configuration file. It uses
	a rolling file appender to reuse the log file, avoiding the issue of
	log files that are too large or losing information from subsequently
	running the program. It also increases the threshold and removes the
	very slow file and line calculations.

			The customized layout for the log messages.
			  %5p: Log level (DEBUG, WARN, etc). The 5 gives the field a fixed length of 5
			       characters, for formatting purposes.
			  %t:  Date and time (in ISO 8601 format)
			  %F:  The file the log command was in. Program must have been compiled with debug mode
			       on. Extremely slow, so should not be used in a release version.
			  %L:  The line number the log command was in. Program must have been compiled with
			       debug mode on. Extremely slow, so should not be used in a release version.
			  %m:  The actual log message
			  %n:  A new line character (OS dependent)
			Example: [2013-09-26 17:13:05,049]  INFO (DemoMain.java:16) - Started logging...
