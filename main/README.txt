To import the project into Eclipse:
	- Go to File > Import
	- Under "General", choose "Existing Projects into Workspace"
	- As the root directory, choose the folder containing this file, which
	  should also contain a file named ".classpath" and a file named
	  ".project"
	- Leave everything else at the default and choose "finish". The project
	  should now be imported into the package explorer.
	- To verify the importation was successful, attempt to run the program.
	  It should be able to find all the imported packages.
