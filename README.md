FBMS
====

File Backup and Management System

FBMS is a simple backup solution for keeping a folder automatically backed up with revisions. You can think of it like Dropbox or Google Drive, but functioning entirely local.

Since this project was imported from SVN, the folder structure is a rather non-traditional.

Information on building is in doc/coding.txt. Since the project was an assignment for a class, the doc folder contains mostly papers that the class required.

The main folder contains everything required to build FBMS, including libraries, resources, scripts, the source code, and licensing information.

The util folder contains an early stage prototype.

FBMS is licensed under the GPL v3, with portions under the Apache license and LGPL.
